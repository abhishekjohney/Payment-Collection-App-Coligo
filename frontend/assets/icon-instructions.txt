SPLASH SCREEN & ICON SETUP
===========================

The app is configured to use these image files:
- icon.png (1024x1024)
- splash.png (1284x2778 for best results)  
- adaptive-icon.png (1024x1024 for Android)

Current Status:
---------------
The app will use default Expo icons until custom images are added.
The background color is set to #6C5CE7 (purple).

To add custom images:
--------------------
1. Create or download your icon and splash images
2. Place them in this 'assets' folder with the exact names above
3. Recommended tools: Canva, Figma, or any graphic design tool
4. Icon should be simple and recognizable at small sizes
5. Splash should have your logo/branding centered

For now, the app will work perfectly with Expo's default images!
The purple background color (#6C5CE7) will be visible.
